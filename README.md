libboys
=======

This is the README for libboys, a FORTRAN90 library to numerically evaluate the Boys function F_n(x) [1]: 

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_n%28x%29%3D%5Cint_0%5E1t%5E%7B2n%7De%5E%7B-xt%5E2%7Ddt)

This function is needed for quantum chemical calculations to solve molecular integrals. However, there is no analytical solution to solve the Boys function (except for very specific cases). The accuracy of the numerical implementation in libboys is achieved by precalculated values and a recursive formula up to six orders.

CMake addition
--------------

1. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
2. Change into the build directory:

    ```bash
    cd build

3. Run CMake to configure the project:

    ```bash
    cmake ..

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    make

5. Optionally, manually run the test:

    ```bash
    make run_test

6. Run all tests using CTest:

    ```bash
    ctest
